This is a topic that tends to wiggle under my skin. Not a week goes by without an
email arriving in my inbox promising exposure, future business, or even worse,
a promise to eventually pay for my services (if the project turns a profit) in

or "spec work" for short. Not only does this tactic not work with me, it's infuriating and is
a perpetual annoyance for creatives in every industry. I can honestly say that in my ten years
of working in the digital medium, I've never agreed to do spec work for a prospective client.
Here are a few reasons why.
